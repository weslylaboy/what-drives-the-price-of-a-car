The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.

The target variable is the price of the car, and the features include various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. The goal is to identify which features are most influential in determining the price of a used car and to provide actionable insights for the used car dealership to optimize their inventory and pricing strategies.\n",

The absolute mean error for Random Forest is `$3,203`, much lower than the other three models which all have errors exceeding `$5,000`. This means that, on average, the Random Forest model price prediction deviates from the actual car prices by about `$3,203`. The r2 score means the model explain nearly `81.7%` of the variance in used cars."

This is likely due to depreciation over time. The second most important feature is the odometer value, which also makes sense as cars with higher mileage tend to be less valuable.\n",

    "To maximize profit and accuracy in pricing, dealers must prioritize:\n",
    "- **Age of the Car**: Older cars depreciate faster, so dealers should consider this when setting prices.\n",
    "- **Odometer Value**: Higher mileage reduces value, so dealers should adjust prices accordingly.\n",
    "- **Model Popularity**: Dealers should stock popular models to capitalize on demand.\n",
    "- **Regional Pricing**: Prices vary by region, so dealers should consider local market conditions.\n",
    "- **Drive Train**: The drive system is a top 5 price impact so is a strong predictor for price, and dealers should pay close attention to local demand for `4WD` vs `FWD`.\n",
    "- **Vehicle Type**: The type of vehicle (sedan, SUV, etc.) can significantly impact pricing, so dealers should consider this when setting prices.\n",
    "- **Fuel Type**: Diesel vehicles are generally more expensive than gasoline vehicles, so dealers should adjust prices accordingly.\n"
