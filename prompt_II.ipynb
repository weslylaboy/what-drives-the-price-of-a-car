The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.

The target variable is the price of the car, and the features include various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. The goal is to identify which features are most influential in determining the price of a used car and to provide actionable insights for the used car dealership to optimize their inventory and pricing strategies.\n",
